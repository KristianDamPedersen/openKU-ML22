## The imaginary number $i$
The real number line, denoted $\mathbb R$ contains all rational numbers, integers, algebraic and transcendental numbers such as $\pi$ and $e$. This set of numbers has some limitations that are resolved by defining a new number that is the solution to the following expression: $i^2=-1$. Fret not if this definition isn't intuitive, $i$ also has a logical explanation within geometry. Imagine a cluster of dots on the real number line. Multiplication by a constant (for instance 2) will scale the distance between all dots uniformly. Multiplication by -1 will do the same thing as mirroring the dots across the number line or the same as a $180^\circ$ rotation. Subsequent multiplications by -1 will result in the dots flipping back and forth. A sensible conclusion could be that there should exist a number that rotates the numbers $90^\circ$ around the number line. 2 subsequent multiplications of this number should result in -1. This will result in us having a number $x$ which squared results in -1. This is the same as the imaginary number $i$
## Complex numbers
Complex numbers, denoted with the set $\mathbb C$, define all numbers in the form of $a+bi$ where $\forall a+bi \in \mathbb C \mid a \in \mathbb R \land a\in \mathbb R$
