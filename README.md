# Machine Learning and Data Science 2022 - Open notes initiative
Welcome to the Machine Learning and Data Science Open Notes initiative for the 
class of 2022.
The goal of this initiative is to provide one convenient location to find the 
notes for all of the classes undertaken by us on our bachelor. 
We aim to leverage our combined knowledge to produce high-quality and easily 
readable notes for all to enjoy, by providing a repo where we can share, edit 
and update collective notes.
Everything in this repo is open-source under the MIT License, so you are all 
free to copy, distribute and otherwise use the material found here.

## DISCLAIMER
Whilst we aim to provide the most accurate information possible through this 
repo, we are after all only students. This means that any given piece of 
information might be incorrect or misunderstood. We aim to retroactively update 
knowledge as we go, but we provide no guarantees for the accuracy of what we 
write. Approach everything with some healthy scepticism.
