# How to contribute to the project


# Guiding principles
## No assignments before deadline
This is an open-source project to centralise notes from old lectures and examples of old assignments. Anything that hasn't passed the deadline can be used for cheating and plagiarism and henceforth is **strictly forbidden**.
## English
Notes shall be written in english to ensure inclusivity and to make everything easier to keep track of. Terms can optionally be written in both danish and english if if deemed necessary. 
> Example:  
> The domain/værdimængde of $f(x)$...

## Guides
Write your contributions as a guide to solve a set of problems or explain concepts that you find difficult. This results in better notes that don't contain irrelevant information and it increases readability.
## Markdown
All contributions shall be written in Markdown so they can easily be converted to $ \LaTeX $ and PDF.
A useful guide for Markdown syntax can be found here:
